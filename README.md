This repository is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/acaudwell/Logstalgia). I am not the author and I did not participate in the development.

The purpose of this repository is to provide pre-built binaries for Windows - you can find those under releases. More information in the [following article](https://retifrav.github.io/blog/2019/08/17/logstalgia-windows-build/).
